Bullet:
    - I want to shoot every 100ms, in order to do that I need to create the clock and allow
    the bulletCreate function to be called every 100ms.
    The bulletClock is already restarting in the playerShooting method.
    - I need to have the vector and functions in main.cpp, it's easier tto handle the objects 
    like this.

Enemy:
    - I need the enemies to spawn very fast
    - I'd like to create a wave system soo each wave will have an increasingly large amount of 
    enemies spawning.
    - Each enemy should have a health pool, regular one should die after 3-4 hits.
    
Enemy BOSS:
    - Works the same way a regular enemy does, however spawns an x amount of times /wave, much
    less then a mini enemy does and has a much larger health pool.
    - Bigger and more scary texture.

Pickups:
    - I'd like to have a health mechanics, random heart appearing in the arena to regenerate health.
    - random boosts that last few seconds like firing a larger amount of bullet/shot.

Stats:
    - health stat, just a number, each time the player gets hit he loses a health point.
    - score, each enemy will add a different amount of points.
    (Maybe save the scores somewhere into a txt file?)

Mechanics:
    - I want to add an attack that the enemy would perform when close to a player, 
    for example if he comes into a certain distance, cast a skill, and if player is then still in
    range, -1 health

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I need to have a variable - maxEnemies.
I can add another variable like enemyCount that is initialy equal to zero and every time the
createEnemy function get called it get bigger.
Once it's equal to maxEnemies, it shouldn't spawn.
I can restart the enemy count and increase maxEnemies once the program detecs the enemy vector is
empty.

if (!roundInProgress)
    I have to restart the restartClock when the roundInProgress variable swaps to false.
    then, If I have 5 seconds on the clock

    So the game grashes on the health-- line.
    I have no idea why, it's just a variable.
    It doesn't do anything on it's own.
#So what was happening there is i was working on a variable associated to all tthe objects - health
#instead of accessing it by saying enemyVec[i].health.

Attacking the enemy:
void enemyAttack
if (enemyVec[i].attackBounds.constains(playerPos)){
    attack();
}

void attack()
{
    playerHealth--;
}

So once a boss is killed, i can no longer kill regular enemies.

!! I had a bug where enemies grouped up together with a boss would crash the game
if i killed the boss sending a "segmentation fault" error. From what I understand it's 
because I was attempting to access memory I didn't own. So i added: if (enemyVec.size() > 0 || bossVec.size() > 0)

I should try reworking the healthpickup class so that it supports ammo and health.
